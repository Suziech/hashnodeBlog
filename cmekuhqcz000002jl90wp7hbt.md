When you practice Capoeira, you naturally get exposed to **Capoeira songs**.  
Since Capoeira is a Brazilian martial art, its songs are sung in **Portuguese.**

At first, I could only hum along and memorise the sounds without knowing their meaning. But as I started learning the lyrics, I realised that understanding the words makes singing much more meaningful.

Also, looking at the lyrics while listening helps improve pronunciation. That‚Äôs why I find it really helpful to **practice songs with lyrics in front of me.** (Portuguese and English pronunciation aren‚Äôt too different-though there are some small differences, haha)

### Why I Built This App

When I was practicing Capoeira I noticed there was no website where you could easily see Capoeira lyrics with Korean translations.

So, I decided to create one myself! üöÄ

### Tech Stack

I built the app from scratch using:

* Next.js
    
* TailwindCSS
    
* TypeScript
    
* i18next
    

Currently, the lyrics data is stored on the client side, but my next step is to move it to **Supabase** so the app can fetch data dynamically.

In the future, I‚Äôd also like to integrate **AI translation** so that people from all over the world can access the content in their own language üåè.

### What‚Äôs Next

This project started from my love for Capoeira music, but my goal is to make it a global resource where anyone can learn, sing, and enjoy Capoeira songs, no matter what language they speak.

This is a capoeira lyrics translation website üëâ [https://www.capoeiracanto.com](https://www.capoeiracanto.com/en)
