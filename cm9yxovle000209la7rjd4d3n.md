# **What is a Generic Function in TypeScript?**

In TypeScript, a **generic function** is a function that can work with multiple types of data. By using generics, we can dynamically define the types of the input and return values, which increases the reusability and maintainability of the code. A generic function doesn’t need to know the exact types in advance; the type is determined when the function is called, at runtime.

For example, when you want a function to handle different types for its parameters and return value, generics allow you to do so. Generics use type parameters like T as placeholders to define the type dynamically.

Here’s simple example of using a generic function in TypeScript. the `identity` function uses the generic type `T`, allowing it to accept any thpe of value.

```typescript
function identity<T>(value: T): T {
    return value;
}

let result = identity(5) // result is of type 'number'
let result2 = identity("hello") // result2 is of type 'string'
```

In this example, the `identity` function uses the generic type `T`. This allows the function to work with various types, such as `number`, `string`, etc. TypeScrhipt automatically infers the type of `T` when the function is called.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, generic functions in TypeScript are an essential tool that increases code reusability and safety. By dynamically handling types, they help in writing more maintainable and flexible code. Understanding and utilising generics effectively can lead to more efficient and stable programming.
