# [Angular] Creating Components with the CLI

We can create component manually by adding a folder with our component or we use the CLI with :

```bash
ng generate component [folder-name]
```

or simply you can type :

```bash
ng g c [folder-name]
```

Once you enter, it will give you a new folder in your app folder with the name of your component and in there, you basically find the same files as you had for the app component, HTML, CSS, TS and the spec file which basically is used for testing.
